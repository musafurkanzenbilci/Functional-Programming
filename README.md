# Functional Programming

This repository contains examples of functional programming in Haskell. The examples cover a variety of functional programming concepts and techniques, including recursion, higher-order functions, and immutable data structures.


## Projects

1. **Rock Sampling On Mars Simulation**: This project is a simulation of a robotic rock sampling mission on Mars. The simulation is implemented in Haskell and demonstrates the use of functional programming concepts to model the behavior of the robot, the environment, and the samples.

2. **Special Digit Class For Phonebook**:  This project is a phonebook application that uses a special digit class to store phone numbers. The class and its associated methods are implemented in Haskell and demonstrate the use of functional programming concepts to create a custom data structure and associated methods.

3. **JSON Prettification**: An implementation of simple prettification of JSON objects in Haskell.

4. **Encryption**: Takes an Int with 4 digits as the password of the customer and returns an Int as the encrypted password by processing the digits in the original one.

5. **Compound Interest Calculator**: Calculates the money the customers would have after the compound interests are applied according to their initial money and how many years they want to invest their money to the bank.

6. **Convert to TL Calculator**: A function named convertTL which takes a Double value and a String representing the name of currency which the given money in Turkish Liras will be converted to.

7. **Lists with different Types**: Generation of lists with different features.

8. **Count on Watch**: An implementation of function that returns the number of watches a guardian have in a specified time limit.
